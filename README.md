# 📚 External Sorting Algorithm - Bachelor Thesis 🎓

In my bachelor thesis, I delve into the world of external sorting to address the challenge of sorting large datasets stored on external storage mediums, such as hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs). 

The External Sorting Algorithm is meticulously designed to handle massive amounts of data that cannot be accommodated in memory. By employing a combination of in-memory and disk-based operations, this algorithm optimizes the sorting process while minimizing memory usage and disk I/O operations.This implementation includes several components, including a series of index files (e.g., **index0.html, index1.html**) and a JavaScript script that orchestrates the sorting process.

⚙️ The algorithm encompasses the following key steps:
 - Partitioning: The dataset is divided into manageable blocks that can fit into memory.
 - Sorting: Each partition is sorted in-memory using established sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
 - Merging: The sorted partitions are merged, resulting in a fully sorted dataset.

💡 Leveraging the External Sorting Algorithm enables efficient sorting of massive datasets, making it highly valuable for data-intensive applications such as large-scale data analytics, data warehousing, and data mining.

Embark on this journey through my bachelor thesis and gain insights into the powerful realm of external sorting, unlocking the potential to efficiently manage and sort vast amounts of data.
