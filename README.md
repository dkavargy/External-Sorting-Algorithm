# External-Sorting-Algorithm

In the present thesis are featured two web applications, which were designed for understanding the function of External Sorting and Block Nested Loop Join algorithms. The main focus here is to study those algorithms, to understand how they work and how important they are. These algorithms have been created to sort and compare respectively, a massive number of data. Therefore, this is very useful because it helps the pc communicate with an extra temporary memory (Ram) or a hard drive
